# Arma3-Home-Unlimited
Home Unlimited is a randomly generated mission where players spawn inside a house and must eliminate all the murderers that are trying to kill them. Players and murderers will also spawn with a random gun (depending on the mission parameter and addons loaded). 

Murderers wear balacavas and bandannas (or any sort of mask) while friendlies don't. 

You can set your parameters to change how random spawn locations are generated, how many enemies there are, enemies skills, how far do enemies start from you, what type of weapons you or your enemies will spawn with, how many grenades you or your enemies start with, what kind of armor are you or your enemies going to wear, how much first aid kits will you or your enemies have, time of day, and weather. 

Optional addons are also supported for this mission. If the host or server runs any supported addons, there will be more weapons or clothings that can possibly be randomized to you.

Note:
------
- Press "F" or whatever you cycle weapon key is at the start to pull out your weapon (if you are playing on dedicated servers) 
- There are 169 randomized handpicked locations on Stratis
- There are 20 randomized handpicked locations on Altis. You also have the option to directly spawn at the handpick locations instead of randomizing them on the Altis version.

Known Issues:
--------------
- Completely randomized spawns that are not handpicked may bug out and not spawn enemies. You'll get an instant mission complete if that happen. This is often the case if the random location happens to be a small island and the enemy spawn distance parameter lands in the water for every spots selected.
